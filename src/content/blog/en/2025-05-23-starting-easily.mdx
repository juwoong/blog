For several weeks, the thought that I was reaching a dead end scared me,
and I spent energy recklessly, engulfed by the overwhelming feeling of not knowing what to do.

And then the embarrassment and difficulty disappeared, leaving only the thought that I had to do something. That was a few days ago.
After that, I actively started laying out my concerns.

![Memo with a friend today](../../../assets/articles/todoing_memo.webp)

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{performance} &= \text{valid tacit knowledge} \times \text{valid explicit knowledge} \\
&\times \text{practice} \times \text{habit} \times \text{(meta-cognition)} \\
&\times \text{social capital} \times \text{luck}
\end{aligned}
$$

I had only understood this formula in my head, but I'm starting to get a sense of how to actually apply it.
When you don't understand a situation well, approaching it by trying to fix your weaknesses in the performance formula right away is too difficult an approach.
While understanding the problem situation, you should leverage your strengths from the performance formula to simplify the complex problem somewhat,
and then make efforts to fill in the lacking parts afterward.

I concluded that what I need to do for this is as follows.
Starting tomorrow, for at least a week, I thought I should take each day to clearly work through the following.

Let me try leaving posts on my blog every day.

< Summary >

1. Define my problems more sharply than anyone else
2. Don't do unfamiliar work
3. Break things into small pieces, but think about how I can do it in a way that's advantageous for my next task
4. Gradually expand my comfort zone
