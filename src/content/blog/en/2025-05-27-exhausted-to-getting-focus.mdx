Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday - I kept doing something, going somewhere, and finally on Monday things fell apart.
My stomach felt so bad that I took a taxi home, and the next day I basically lost a whole day of classes.

My head wouldn't work as if something had burst, so I threw away all tasks and just rested at home. As I stayed there, I felt peaceful. And I started thinking about what I could let go of. To be exact, only a few problems remained in my head, and many problems that had been troubling me usually disappeared from my mind.

This problem occurred because I had put too many things in my head at once.
If it's not something that absolutely must be done, let's do it at the end of the day. The important things can be done at the beginning of the day.
If I keep organizing my thoughts that way, I think I can get a little better every day.
