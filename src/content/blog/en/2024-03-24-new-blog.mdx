I deleted my old blog and created a new one. For quite a long time, I had the desire to run a blog well, but I kept postponing the blog setup work with various excuses.

Why was that? I think I considered setting up a blog well to be a very big task. After thinking for so long about wanting to make a beautiful blog, making a pretty blog became more important than writing good content.

After procrastinating for so long (over a year;), I came across Paul Graham's blog.

It's a blog that's still being maintained, and he keeps writing in that same state regardless of design or anything else.
The design itself isn't pretty, but it gives the most important lesson. What matters in the end is nothing else but the writing.

So I just removed all the design and made it like this. Didn't use a single img tag in the theme.
Instead of making it fancy, I'm going to try to write more often.
