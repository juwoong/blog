I'm in the middle of continuously building things and trying to get feedback from people around me.
One of the things I've often said, "a company's problems are the CEO's problems," is essentially being thrown back at me now.

Development itself is just something I can do, but getting people to use what I've built is the big problem.
I've always been someone who worked alone, and receiving help from others is very difficult for me.
But paradoxically, if I want to do my own thing, I desperately need help from others.

Also, my stamina and focus are constantly lacking. I keep looking for fun things, and I can feel my body getting heavier.
I can't stick to one thing persistently, and in my impatience, I keep looking for other things.

I think I feel more anxious because there's nowhere that feels stable.
Maybe in times like this, I need to have a stable anchor point within myself?
These days, my weaknesses that were previously invisible are approaching me as problems to solve one by one.

The concern I feel most these days is this:

1. How can I create a compound effect to grow every single day?
