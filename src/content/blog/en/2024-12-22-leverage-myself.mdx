I think humans should be viewed separately as a machine that acts—and a higher-level concept that sets goals and determines action plans. This doesn't mean to work hard like a machine, but rather to recognize your own strengths and be able to see yourself as a kind of tool for problem solving.

I'm a person who wants to solve problems with high aspirations, and I think the strengths I have have been of great help in solving such problems. However, as someone who wants to better utilize this paradigm of change, I feel that my identity as an "engineer" hasn't been very helpful.

Until now, whenever an interesting new idea came to mind, I started all projects by calling the `git init` command. The start of every project was code. While developing like that is very enjoyable for me, looking at how I work, it's full of ridiculous inefficiencies.

Framework setup for project setup, writing code for configuration settings, installing Dockerfile for deployment, ORM setup, etc. Of course, such duplicate work can be extracted into templates or libraries, but these considerations don't help at all in confirming that the problem I thought of and the solution method are appropriate. And this "identity as an engineer" has been an obstacle to fast problem solving.

So to summarize... I'm "someone who wants to solve problems in more fun and excellent ways," not an engineer. This change in perspective will allow me to view and solve problems from more diverse angles.
