New ideas keep coming to me even while I'm working on one thing. It might be fine if these ideas came occasionally, but they come so frequently that they often interfere with the work itself.
Sometimes they're entirely new ideas, but more often they're ideas about improvements or future directions for the code I'm currently writing. In these cases, there are the following problems:

1. If I think about these separately, that level of improvement doesn't come to mind easily.
2. But if I let myself keep thinking about it, my head fills up with it and interferes with work progress.

So while wondering what to do about this, I decided to use `TODO` comments.
The method is to write a `TODO` comment on the spot, and review and organize them when I start coding each day.

I'll test this and continue recording in this document.
