"Boilerplate" is a word primarily used at the code level, meaning code that is necessary to start a project. So in the project setup stage, you often deal with boilerplate code. But even such code has become easy to generate with the development of AI.

However, the true meaning of boilerplate has a deeper meaning than that. When we look at code written with the help of AI, it becomes a state where we can't easily work with it. Think about reviewing a codebase you know nothing about. It requires much more cognitive effort than writing the code yourself.

In the end, this becomes a bottleneck for all productivity. Because it becomes difficult to say how to fix the code, even with vibe coding, writing code itself becomes difficult. So, only when you've reached a stage where you can quickly write code by overcoming all cognitive hurdles including this can you truly reach the boilerplate stage.
