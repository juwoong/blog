I once had a conversation with a friend about "being young." My friend said they felt someone was "young" when they seemed to be hiding their weaknesses. I don't completely agree, but looking back at my early 20s when I didn't want to be seen as young, I think I behaved that way too. It seems like a trait that appears in kids who "don't want to be young."

Separately from that, there's something to think about regarding the attitude of accepting weaknesses. Most of us try not to reveal our weaknesses because revealing them is embarrassing. However, I feel it's important to reveal weaknesses to get feedback on them and pursue development accordingly.

But most people only think about the primary result (embarrassment) and refuse. Or even setting aside the primary result, they worry about results that haven't actually happened (it will hold me back). But let's think about the secondary and tertiary results behind that.

The secondary result is grabbing the opportunity to improve my weakness by doing so. By doing so, you can solve the fundamental cause and move on to the next direction. The tertiary result? It's eliminating true weaknesses that will arise in the future. By solving my weaknesses, I reduce factors that could emotionally shake me later. (I can reduce points of emotional disturbance, commonly expressed as "getting scratched.")
