I wrote this transfer statement in a hurry, but I feel my head clearing a bit.

Watching the emergence and development of ChatGPT, I resolved to transfer to the Philosophy department.

The biggest lesson I learned during my 7-year leave of absence working as a software developer was that "questions are more important than anything else." Even in the same situation, completely different results can emerge depending on how you ask questions, and the difference between the advantages of good questions and the damage of bad questions was too large to easily bridge. These experiences gave me deep contemplation about how to ask good questions.

My thoughts about questions became more firm with the emergence and development of GPT. Due to the nature of the software developer industry being sensitive to new technologies, I had been using and watching this technology even before GPT-3.5 was released to the general public in November 2022. While observing various use cases from colleagues in the same industry, I discovered something interesting. Even when the same technology was used by people with the same job, some were excited saying "this will change the future," while others dismissed it as "still premature."

Curious about what created this difference, I observed various people's use cases and arrived at a conclusion. It was the difference in how they made requests. People who were dissatisfied with AI mostly made vague questions and requests, but those who were satisfied mostly had clear questions and requests, and guided the AI well to reach the desired conclusion. Watching these patterns, I became convinced that the ability to think logically and communicate that thinking will be a core competency for humans in the current and future AI era.

I believe the Philosophy department is the most suitable place to learn and develop the ability to question logically. This is because it is a discipline that has grown over 2,500 years by questioning and answering about the world. Because it deals with thinking - the act that makes humans most human - it can be said to be a discipline that explores the essence of humanity. Perhaps because of this history, unlike science, philosophy has developed to make us think about how to think. In other words, it is a discipline that helps develop the ability to think. This ability to think for oneself will be a tool that supports me throughout my life in an increasingly complex world overflowing with information.

There is a high possibility that I will continue working as a software developer even after graduation. Of course, I might take a different path. But whichever path I take, if I develop the ability to think for myself by learning about past philosophers' thinking and logical development in the Philosophy department, I will gain a great weapon for my future life.

This is why I want to transfer from Chemical Engineering to Philosophy.
