At some point, I stopped making plans. I used to make grand plans every year and repeatedly fail, so I only accumulated stress from not keeping my plans. After repeating this for several years, I stopped making plans about two years ago. I approached it with "Let's just respond well to whatever comes!"

But living like this, I felt like my life was drifting. When you think about it, it's obvious—to get lost, you need to have a destination or direction. But because I didn't like the feeling of being lost, I just stopped setting a destination.

So I decided to set the biggest direction. So what if the plan is wrong? Being wrong in predictions is natural, and to move forward, you have to solve the problems you face. I decided to accept the feeling of being lost as "evidence that I'm solving problems."

Now the most important question remains. What do I find valuable?
