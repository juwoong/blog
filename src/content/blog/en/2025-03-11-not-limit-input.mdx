Something Lee Dong-jin said in an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YLonjnptTw) touched my heart. Ah, this is why I keep feeling empty. My Input is less than my Output.
I hate that emptiness so much that I wanted to solve this problem, so for a while my topic was how to increase Input.

But it didn't increase well. I thought it was because my mind was busy, and I tried to squeeze things in more in spare moments. But (of course) it didn't work well. Then a few days ago I had a major mental realization. I've been limiting Input too much.

Actually, we can gain enlightenment from everything. From conversations, from just thinking, from changes in perspective. In various ways. But for some reason, I kept trying to get knowledge only from books or writings.

Let's not forget. I can learn from everything, and only then can I get a little better every day.
